#This is a codebook for the getting and cleaning data course project

##Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

## Download zip file from website

## Unzip data

##load data into R

The training data is loaded as "train.x" for X_train.txt fle in subfolder train and training labels as "train.y" for Y_train.txt file in same subfolder.

The training subject data is loaded as "train.subject" for subject_train.txt file

The testing data is loaded as "test.x" for X_test.txt file in subfolder test and test labels as test.y for Y_test.txt file in the same subfolder.

The test subject data is loaded as "test.subject" for subject_test.txt file

## merge train and test data

At first we merge train.subject, train.y, train.x using cbind into "trainData". 

Then merge test.subject, test.y, test.x using cbind into "testData". 

Using rbind function to merge trainData, testData into "fullData".

# Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

##load feature name into R

Load feature names as variable featureName.

##extract mean and standard deviation of each measurements

Choose feature names with mean or sd as variable featureIndex.

The finalData is subset of fullData of column 1, 2, and featureIndex plus two.

#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

## load activity data into R

## replace 1 to 6 with activity names

# Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.

# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
